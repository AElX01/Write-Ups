# How I learn hacking

Learning resources I use (take into account I have a VIP student account on HTB):

- https://portswigger.net
- https://academy.hackthebox.com

**Note:** I had no idea how to organize machines, so that's up to you, you can spend the whole weekly plan owning retired machines, or, decide when to pick up your first easy-medium or even hard machine. Is not about being able to solve a machine but learning, so, it doesn't really matter if it's easy or insane.

**Some advices**

- Build your own labs for each topics, you can use any hypervisor, docker containers or network emulators if you want to train the networking side.
- Use Wireshark, and try to do MANUAL stuff, use tools of course, but try to learn hacking techniques without them.
- Anything can be an attacker machine if you know how to use it, even Windows (I recommend WSL), so, it doesn't matter what you use as long as you study.
- Take **MEANINGFUL** notes, and if you are planning to get a certification, take even more notes.
- If you are an autodidact person, notes are not going to make you understand, make write ups and labs to explain yourself the concepts!
